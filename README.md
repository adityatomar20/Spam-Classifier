## Spam-Detection

- The goal of this project is to develop a spam detection classification model that can accurately distinguish between spam and non-spam messages. The model will be evaluated using two metrics: accuracy and a custom-defined misclassification cost.

- To begin, a dataset of messages will be used to train and test the models. This dataset will be split into two parts: a training set and a testing set. The training set will be used to train the model, while the testing set will be used to evaluate the model's performance.

- The first metric used to evaluate the models will be accuracy. This measures how well the model can correctly identify spam and non-spam messages. The higher the accuracy, the better the model performs.

- The second metric used to evaluate the models will be a custom-defined misclassification cost. This metric takes into account the cost of misclassifying a message as spam or non-spam. For example, misclassifying a non-spam message as spam could result in the user missing important information, while misclassifying a spam message as non-spam could result in the user receiving unwanted messages. Therefore, a cost will be assigned to each type of misclassification, and the model's performance will be evaluated based on its ability to minimize the overall misclassification cost.

- After training and testing each model, the results will be compared based on both accuracy and misclassification cost. The model with the highest accuracy and lowest misclassification cost will be selected as the best model for spam detection.

- Finally, to ensure the validity of the results, the selected model will be tested on a separate dataset to confirm its performance. If the model performs well on the new dataset, it can be considered a reliable and accurate spam detection model.
